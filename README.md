# Sensei Atsume: Teacher Collector!

## Description

Sensei Atsume: Teacher Collector! puts a unique twist on the mobile cat-collecting game Neko Atsume. In this game, the goal is to collect as many Magnet teachers as possible by buying specialized goodies from the shop. Since the goodies can get expensive, you can earn more money (tears) by answering some quiz questions in a trivia minigame. The game is complete when all 12 available teachers have been collected!

## Commands

* Clear the screen: SPACE
* Open Shop: RIGHT ARROW
* Open Trivia: T
* Move shop picker up and down: UP and DOWN ARROWS
* Continue/confirm: ENTER or RIGHT ARROW (see onscreen directions)
